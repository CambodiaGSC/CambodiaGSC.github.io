#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Greetings from Cambodia, We’re Team Cambodia consisting of eight high school students from E2STEM Education. Although eight of us come from different parts of Cambodia and have different backgrounds with different personalities, when it comes to solving community  problems we become one. Most of the members in team Cambodia have experience with competition, exhibition and workshop that related to STEM. We are extremely excited to face all of the challenges. It is an honor for us to take part in this year's first global challenge and we hope that our team's potential and creation can help make the world a better place during and after this COVID-19 pandemic.
