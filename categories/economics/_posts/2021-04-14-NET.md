#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the spring break, my economics teacher Mr. Mecham organized a team of four students from his econ class to compete in the [Northwestern Economics Tournament](https://economics.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/net/index.html). I was fortunate to be one of the four, and this was the first economics competition that we've all competed in. The problems were very challenging but interesting; I liked them because they required a lot of though rather than just pure mathematical bashing. Although we didn't win first place in either the power round or the buzzer round, we finished near the top in each one.
