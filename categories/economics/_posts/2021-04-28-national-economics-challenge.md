#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a group of classmates from my economics class, our economics teacher organized us into a team for the [National Economics Challenge](https://www.councilforeconed.org/national-economics-challenge/). We did pretty well in the qualifier round where we scored an 870/900, so we made it to the state wide level.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The state competition is usually held in San Francisco, but this year, it was held online. The problems became much harder all of a sudden and we barely made it to the state finals, clinching the ninth spot out of ten.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We knew we had no chance to make it to the final five even if we answered every buzzer question correctly, so we tried to just have some fun. However, some teams were cheating so blatantly that our experience wasn't great. One team was straight up inventing new economic terms by combining other team's answers.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite some annoyance in the final stages of this competition, I'm still really happy that I had the chance to compete in it.
